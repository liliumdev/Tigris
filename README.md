# Tigris

A multi-threaded eRepublik bot with proxy support, custom HTTP client (or alternative cURL client). Comes with basic anti-leak protection, so it can only be delivered to verified end-users (some data neccessary for Tigris to work was hosted and delivered via a server - namely, CSS selector strings). 

It was able to do almost anything, from creating the account to leveling it up automatically. Refer to Tigris User Manual.pdf for more information. I wrote about it in a [blog post here](https://mobsterap.wordpress.com/2012/08/08/on-erepublik/) and meant to follow up with more posts, but never did.

Developed in 2012, maintained to 2014. It's now on github only for archival and educational purposes.
